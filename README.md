# DMRG Simulation of Coupled Frustrated Spin-1/2 Ladders

This repository contains a Julia script to simulate the ground state properties of a quantum magnetic system composed of two coupled, frustrated spin-1/2 ladders. The simulation uses the **Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG)** algorithm implemented via the [ITensors.jl](https://github.com/ITensor/ITensors.jl) library.

## Physical Model

The code models a Hamiltonian for two parallel Heisenberg spin ladders coupled together. The system includes various interaction terms allowing for the study of magnetic frustration:

* **$J_x$**: Antiferromagnetic coupling along the legs (horizontal).
* **$J_y$**: Coupling along the rungs of each individual ladder (intra-ladder).
* **$J_{cy}$**: Coupling along the rungs connecting the two ladders (inter-ladder).
* **$J_{d}$**: Diagonal frustration within each ladder.
* **$J_{cd}$**: Diagonal frustration between the two ladders.

The total system size is defined by $4 \times L_x$, where $L_x$ is the length of the ladders.

## Dependencies

To run this code, you need [Julia](https://julialang.org/) installed along with the following packages:

* `ITensors`
* `ITensorMPS`
* `HDF5`
* `JLD`
* `MKL` (Optional, but recommended for performance on Intel hardware)

You can install these dependencies in the Julia REPL:

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add(["ITensors", "ITensorMPS", "HDF5", "JLD", "MKL"])
````

## Usage

The parameters for the simulation (couplings $J$, system size $L_x$, bond dimensions, etc.) are defined within the script variables. To change the physics of the simulation, edit the variables at the bottom of the `.jl` file.

### Running the Simulation

To execute the code, use the Julia command line. It is highly recommended to use the `-t` flag to specify the number of threads. The code is optimized to use ITensors' threaded block-sparse operations.

**Command syntax:**

```bash
julia -t [number_of_cores] [script_name].jl
```

**Example:**

To run the simulation using 4 CPU threads:

```bash
julia -t 4 script.jl
```

## Output

The script calculates and saves the following data to `.jld` files in the working directory:

1.  **Energy**: Ground state energy.
2.  **Magnetization**: Local $\langle S^z \rangle$ expectation values.
3.  **Correlation Matrices**:
      * Longitudinal: $\langle S^z_i S^z_j \rangle$ (`czz`)
      * Transverse: $\langle S^+_i S^-_j \rangle$ (`cpm`) and $\langle S^-_i S^+_j \rangle$ (`cmp`)
